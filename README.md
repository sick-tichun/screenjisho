# screenjisho
like jisho.org but systemwide, using optical character recognition so it is acsessible from anywhere
created mostly so i could play video games in japanese and therefore learn japanese at the same time 




# todo
  -better tune ocr
  -display infromation better (planned = locally hosted webserver with outputs on site (as it can be viewed from steam overlay and wont require tabin/out))
  -other language support (though just in google translate as thats not the focus of the program)
  -audio recording support (takes audio ouptut from computer and translates it)
