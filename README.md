# screenjisho
like the yomichan browser extentinos but systemwide, using optical character recognition so it is acsessible from anywhere, created mostly so i could play video games in japanese and therefore learn japanese at the same time

# installation
only works on windows ðŸ˜­
run: `pip install pytorch jamdict pywin32 easyocr pynput` <br>
then run main.py (as administrator if you want it to work with games like csgo)

# usage
hold keybind (currently f7) and drag over the text you want to be searched up with jmdict, it will be output on terminal (soon browser)


# todo
  * better tune ocr
  * display infromation better (planned = locally hosted webserver with outputs on site (as it can be viewed from steam overlay and wont require tabin/out))
  * other language support (though just in google translate as thats not the focus of the program)
  * audio recording support (takes audio ouptut from computer and translates it)
